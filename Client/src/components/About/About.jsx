                    About Me
                </h1>
             My name is Jorge Tambley, and I'm a passionate Full Stack Developer.
             I'm currently studying a range of web development technologies, including
              JavaScript, React, HTML, and CSS. From a young age, I've always been interested
               in technology and its ability to solve complex problems. As I continued to 
               learn and explore the field, I discovered a deep love for coding and developing 
               solutions that make a real difference in people's lives.
    
        In my free time, you'll often find me tinkering with new projects, experimenting
         with different programming languages, and expanding my knowledge of the latest 
         web development trends. I'm constantly seeking out new challenges and opportunities 
         to push myself further, and I'm always excited to learn something new.
        
        Ultimately, my goal as a Full Stack Developer is to create meaningful and 
        impactful applications that make a difference in the world. Whether it's a 
        new website, a mobile app, or a complex web application, I believe that 
        technology has the power to change the way we live and work for the better. 
        I'm excited to be a part of this rapidly-evolving industry, and I can't 
        wait to see where my passion for web development takes me in the future.</p></div>
